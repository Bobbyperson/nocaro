## About

Nocaro is a multi-purpose discord bot. It's main appeal is it's wide selection of economy commands. Users are able to earn and gamble Bouge Bucks, a fake currency. 

Nocaro was essentially my introducion to programming, and therefore contains a LOT of really dumb code. You should be careful if you decide to use this project as example code for anything.

## Issues

This is not the version of Nocaro currently running on the public bot. This is because the current version is held together with gum and chicken wire. I'm currently working on cleaning a lot of the code to make easier to work on Nocaro in the future. If you decide to run this bot locally you will likely run into a LOT of issues.
