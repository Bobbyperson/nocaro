## About

Nocaro is a multi-purpose discord bot. It's main appeal is it's wide selection of economy commands. Users are able to earn and gamble Bouge Bucks, a fake currency. 

Nocaro was essentially my introducion to programming, and therefore contains a LOT of really dumb code made over many years. You should be careful if you decide to use this project as example code for anything.

A lot of the economy commands have osu jokes. To get started use `,map` to get Bouge Bucks ($BB). Afterwards, you can gamble your $BB via blackjack, slots, or other games. You can also invest in the stock market. Use `,help` to see all commands.
