# Nocaro Privacy Policy

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

Nocaro stores Message IDs in a database by default. In servers where it is enabled, Nocaro also stores message content long-term for generating sentences with a Markov Chain model. If you delete a message, remove Nocaro from your server, or disable it, the corresponding Message IDs and stored content will be inaccessible or deleted, subject to the bot's data management processes.

## 2. Message Access

Nocaro only accesses and processes messages in the channels it is currently active in. No messages leave the server you are in, except in cases where you private message the bot for support, which may be relayed to the bot maintainer or another channel. Message generation mode uses stored content solely within the server for sentence generation.

## 3. Long-Term Message Storage

In servers with message generation mode disabled, Nocaro does not retain message content beyond its access period. Deleting a message or removing Nocaro from the server renders the corresponding Message ID inaccessible. In servers where it is enabled, message content is stored long-term until disabled or deleted via the `,disablebrain` command, which removes all stored data for that server.

## 4. Functionality and Machine Learning Models

Nocaro does not use large language models (LLMs). It employs a Markov chain model for sentence generation in message generation mode, processing stored message content within the bot's programmed operations. No external machine learning models are utilized.

## 5. Responsibility Disclaimer

Nocaro is not responsible for any messages it generates or regurgitates. The messages Nocaro accesses and uses are drawn exclusively from the active channel where it is present. Generated sentences in message generation mode are based on stored content from that channel and do not reflect external data.

## 6. Open Source

Nocaro is open-source software, and its source code is available at the [Nocaro GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Bobbyperson/nocaro).

## 7. Acceptance of Terms

By using Nocaro, you agree to the terms outlined in this privacy policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, you are advised to remove Nocaro from your server. If you are not the server owner and do not want Nocaro to interact with you, use the `,blacklistme` command. To request deletion of specific Message IDs or message generation data, please DM the bot with your request.
