# Nocaro Privacy Policy

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

Nocaro does not store actual message content. Instead, it stores Message IDs in a database. This means that if you delete a message or remove Nocaro from your server, Nocaro will no longer have access to the associated message.

## 2. Message Access

Nocaro only accesses and processes messages in the channel it is currently active in. No messages leave the server you are in, and Nocaro does not transmit or share message content outside of this scope.

## 3. No Long-Term Message Storage

Nocaro does not retain any message content beyond the time it has access to the server or channel. Deleting a message or removing Nocaro from the server renders the corresponding Message ID inaccessible.

## 4. Limited Functionality and No Machine Learning Models

Nocaro does not contain or use any large language models (LLMs). It solely functions within the boundaries of its programmed operations, which do not include the storage or processing of message content beyond the Message IDs.

## 5. Responsibility Disclaimer

Nocaro is not responsible for any messages it regurgitates. The messages Nocaro accesses and uses are drawn exclusively from the active channel where it is present. Nocaro does not store or process messages from other channels or servers.

## 6. Open Source

Nocaro is open-source software, and its source code is available at the [Nocaro GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Bobbyperson/nocaro).

## 7. Acceptance of Terms

By using Nocaro, you agree to the terms outlined in this privacy policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, you are advised to remove Nocaro from your server. If you are not the server owner, and do not want Nocaro to interact with you, you can use the `,blacklistme` command. If Nocaro holds any message ids from you that you would like deleted, please DM the bot asking for all of or specific message ids to be removed.

**Effective Date:** Sep 9th, 2024
**Last updated:** Sep 23rd, 2024

This policy may be updated periodically, and changes will be reflected in the latest version available in the GitHub repository.
